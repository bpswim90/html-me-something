                    <p>Before St. Louis existed and before America was America, there were already people here building cool things. One such group of people was the Mississippians, who lived in the area of present-day St. Louis and built huge earthen mounds. Cahokia mounds is one example. We aren't entirely sure what they were for, but believe they had wooden structures on them and served some civic or sacred purpose.</p>

                    <p>Fast forward a few hundred years. America is a young nation, and everyone's really all-in with democracy. Architects are giving a shout out to the original democracy, Greece, by sticking Greek temples on everything in a style we now call Greek Revival. The Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis, completed 1864, is a great example of this.</p>

                    <p>By the 1890s, St. Louis was growing fast. In fact, a lot of cities were growing fast and these things called skyscrapers started to show up. At first they were really ugly. The Wainwright building was one of the first to get it right by having a unified aesthetic that emphasized vertical lines. Architect Louis Sullivan was also known for including intricate details in his designs that took inspiration from nature.</p>

                    <p>The 20th century arrived and St. Louis was really on the map. We had the world's fair! To show everyone just how cultured we are we built in the Beaux-Arts style. This school of thought originated at a highly-regarded architecture school in Paris and took cues from renaissance architecture and art. Influences can be found in many other museums and civic buildings across St. Louis and the US from the turn of the 20th century.</p>

                    <p>America's economy boomed in the 1920s and skyscrapers continued to be built at a breakneck pace. However, architects start to move away from the ornate details of earlier decades (such as those seen in the Wainwright). Skyscrapers in this era began to feature pared down, abstract ornamentation, often in the Art Deco style, which emphasized bold geometric shapes. The Continental Life Building, completed 1930, showed art deco influence in details found at the street level and near it's castle-like top.</p>

                    <p>By the mid-20th century, Frank Lloyd Wright had been on the scene for a number of years and was highly influential. He's notable for his prairie-style--fortress-like homes that feature strong horizontal features. He also hates cities, and instead proposes Usonia, a utopian america where citizens live in detached suburban homes in a lush natural environment. The private home he designed in Kirkwood, MO, completed 1952, aligns strongly with these ideals. It also reflects the dramatic population shift in post-war america to the suburbs, for which he was a very early proponent.</p>

                    <p>In midcentury America, radical modernist architects such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe are landing major commissions. Modern construction has allowed for the structure to pushed to the interior, and the formation of a glass curtain wall. Today it probably looks like generic corporate architecture, but at the time it was an expression of the latest advances in design and engineering. This style became widely influential, and led to many imitators, such as University Tower in Richmond Heights, MO, completed 1975.</p>

                    <p>One of Eero Saarinen's masterpieces, the arch is an engineering marvel and a gleaming beacon of optimism. It is a celebration of science and engineering, and combines the symbolism of America's successful westward expansion with the hopefulness of what we still may achieve. The arch succinctly sums up the idealism of the modernists in one iconic statement. </p>

                    <p>From the 1970s onward, some architects started to pull back on the minimalism of earlier modernism. These post-modernists include details and ornament, sometimes ironically, that suggest more traditional architecture. For example, a building with distinctly visible windows, like you might find in the early half of the 20th century, but none of the ornament characteristic of that era. Today most people don't look back too fondly on this style, but maybe one day we will find beauty in its awkwardness. </p>

                    <p>Contemporary architecture takes many forms. Tadao Ando's style, as seen in the Pulitzer Foundation, follows in the forms and materials of the modernists. At the same time, he offers a new sensitivity: his buildings curate sunlight and reflections from the outside to create a unique ambience that changes through the day. </p>
