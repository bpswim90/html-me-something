                    <p>Before St. Louis existed and before America was America, there were already people here building cool things. One such group of people was the Mississippians, who lived in the area of present-day St. Louis and built huge earthen mounds. Cahokia mounds is one example. We aren't entirely sure what they were for, but believe they had wooden structures on them and served some civic or sacred purpose.</p>

                    <p>Fast forward a few hundred years. America is a young nation, and everyone's really all-in with this democracy thing. Architects are giving a shout out to the o.g. democracy, Greece, by sticking Greek temples on everything in a style we now call Greek Revival.</p>

                    <p>By the 1890s, St. Louis was growing fast. In fact, a lot of cities were growing fast and these things called skyscrapers started to show up. At first they were really ugly. The Wainwright building was one of the first to get it right by having a unified aesthetic that emphasized vertical lines.</p>

                    <p>The 20th century arrived and St. Louis was really on the map. We had the world's fair! To show everyone just how cultured we are we built in the Beaux-Arts style, which originated at a fancy architecture school in Paris and took cues from renaissance architecture and art.</p>

                    <p>Architects start to move away from the ornate details of earlier decades in the 1920s. Skyscrapers featured pared down, abstract ornamentation, often in the Art Deco style, which emphasized bold geometric shapes.</p>

                    <p>Frank Lloyd Wright has been on the scene for a number of years. He's notable for his prairie-style--fortress-like homes that feature strong horizontal features. He also hates cities, and instead proposes Usonia, a utopian america where citizens live in detached suburban homes in a lush natural environment. (Sound familiar?)</p>

                    <p>In postwar America, Wright's vision comes to fruition, kind of. At the same time, radical modernist architects such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe are landing major commissions. Modern construction has allowed for the structure to pushed to the interior, and the formation of a glass curtain wall. Today it probably looks like generic corporate architecture, but at the time it was an expression of the latest advances in design and engineering. This style became widely influential, and led to many imitators, such as University Tower.</p>

                    <p>Modernism is now in full swing. One of Eero Saarinen's masterpieces, the arch is an engineering marvel and a gleaming beacon of optimism. Modern architects celebrate science and engineering, and the hope of where they could take the nation. </p>

                    <p>From the 1970s onward, some architects started to pull back on the minimalism of earlier modernism. These post-modernists include details and ornament, sometimes ironically, that suggest more traditional architecture. For example, a building with distinctly visible windows, like you might find in the early half of the 20th century, but none of the ornament characteristic of that era. Today most people kind of hate this aesthetic, but maybe one day we will find beauty in its awkwardness. </p>

                    <p>Contemporary architecture takes many forms. Tadao Ando's style, as seen in the Pulitzer Foundation, follows in the forms and materials of the modernists. At the same time, he offers a new sensitivity: his buildings curate sunlight and reflections from the outside to create a unique ambience that changes through the day. </p>
